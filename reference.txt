- more info can be found in the ST7789VW datasheet

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- display is configured in 4 line serial mode
- The serial output pin (SD0) is not exposed, so it is not possible to read data from the display
- while Inversion Mode is OFF colors appear inverted on the display, turn on for non-inverted colors (see INVON and INVOFF commands)

POWER ON CONFIGURATION:

- this is a list of the default states of some important modes and parameters after the Power On Sequence

Display Inversion                   OFF
Display                             OFF
Normal Display Mode                 ON
Idle Mode                           OFF
Interface Pixel Format              18 bits/pixel (RGB666)
Sleep In                            ON
Column Address Range                Full Display (0-240)
    XS                                  0x0000
    XE                                  0x00EF
Row Address Range                   Full Display (0-320)
    YS                                  0x0000
    YE                                  0x013F

- also important are the parameters controlled by MADCTL: MY, MX, MV, ML, RGB, MH
- how these parameters interact with each other and affect the display output are better explained in the datasheet

- At the bare minimum, you must start the Power On Sequence, exit sleep mode, turn on the display, and turn on display inversion in order to begin using it

CHANGING BRIGHTNESS:

- According to the datasheet, the WRDISBV command allows you to write a brightness value to the display. Unfortunately, WRDISBV doesn't seem to do anything even with BCTRL On.
- I may be missing something important, but brightness can be controlled with PWM on the BL pin instead. 

- I have not tested the Content Adaptive Brightness Control, Display Dimming, or any other brightness related commands/modes
