- this reference attempts to use language, names, and designations from the ST7789VW datasheet whenever possible
- if you do not understand the meaning of specific terms or phrases (e.g Content Adaptive Brightness), the datasheet is a good place to start-+

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- display is configured in 4 line serial mode
- The serial output pin (SD0) is not exposed, so it is not possible to read data from the display
- while Inversion Mode is OFF colors appear inverted on the display, turn on for non-inverted colors (see INVON and INVOFF commands)

POWER ON CONFIGURATION:

- this is a non-exhastive list of the states of some important modes and parameters after the Power On Sequence

Display Inversion                   OFF
Display                             OFF
Normal Display Mode                 ON
Idle Mode                           OFF
Interface Pixel Format              18 bits/pixel (RGB666)
Sleep In                            ON
Column Address Range                Full Display (0-240)
    XS                                  0x0000
    XE                                  0x00EF
Row Address Range                   Full Display (0-320)
    YS                                  0x0000
    YE                                  0x013F

- also important are the parameters controlled by MADCTL: MY, MX, MV, ML, RGB, MH
- how these parameters interact with each other and affect the display output is relatively complicated to explain, so just read the docs

- At the bare minimum, the display must start the Power On Sequence, exit sleep mode, turn on the display, and turn on display inversion in order to begin using the display

CHANGING BRIGHTNESS:

- the WRDISBV command allows you to write a brightness value to the display
- unfortunately, WRDISBV doesn't seem to do anything even with BCTRL On
- the brightness can instead be controlled with PWM on the BL pin

- I have not tested the Content Adaptive Brightness Control, Display Dimming, or any other brightness related commands/modes
